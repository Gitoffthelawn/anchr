  <p class="description">Anchr provides you with kind of a toolbox for tiny tasks on the internet. Currently you can
    <i>upload and share pictures</i>,
    <i>shorten links for easier sharing</i> and <i>create link collections</i>, which are like a bookmark list that is
    accessible from everywhere. Awesome features like a message board, a notes book, a poll service and many more are
    about to come.<br><br>
